Lab Steps
1. Get the student to connect to their Windows Jumpserver
2. Introduce students to Schematics and PowerVS
3. Show diagram of what will be deployed in IBM Cloud
4. Have students create Schematics workspace in their account
5. Run Schematics to deploy the first environment
    - Create PowerVS workspace
    - Create subnet in PowerVS
    - Create SSH key in PowerVS
    - Create Aix LPAR in PowerVS
6. Walk through the code sections with a discription of what that section of code is doing
7. Show a diagram of the next state
8. Modify the Schematics workspace to simuilate changes to the codebase
    - Create VPC
    - Create VPC prefix
    - Create VPC subnet
    - Create SSH key
    - Deploy VPC VSI (Ubuntu)
    - Create FIP and associate it with the VSI
    - Create Local TGW
    - Connect VPC and PowerVS workspaces to it
9. Run the new Schematics code
10. Walk through the code changes
11. Have student connect through the jump server created in the second deployment to connect to the AIX server in PowerVS
12. Have the student destroy the Schematics deployment
13. Have the student destroy the Schematics workspace
